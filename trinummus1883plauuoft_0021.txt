JNTRODUCTION. xvii

unmarried daughter to the care of his friend Callicles; and,
before sailing, had secretly buried within his house a large sum
of money.

Lesbonicus, however, having spent all the money that could
be otherwise raised, put up the house for sale. Callicles, to
whom alone the secret of the treasure had been entrusted,

concluded.
ὓ Aet, ΙΙΙ. Se. 1. When the curtain rises at the next Act
Callicles is informed by Stasimus of the proposed marriage,
