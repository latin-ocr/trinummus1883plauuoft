116 PLA VT] TRJNVMMVS. V. 3. 8—14.

1. 1 18 3. cameletis. The MSS. give Callicli, whjeh follows the analogy
of Ulixi, Themistocli, etc„ but the change is necessitated by the metre-
The use of the genitive -etis is certain, though not proved for the age
of Plautus.

1185. miseria una. For this sentiment, cf. 42—65. The hiatus
after adfatim is justified by the change of speaker.

1187. si facies modo, ‘ (well and good), if you carry it out.'

1 189. Cantor, the singer who had to recite the parts of the play set
to music, while the actor accompanied him with appropriate gestures.
He appeared at the end of the Play, and said1to the audience‚ vos valete
ct plaudite or plaudite. Cf. Hor. A. P. 15 5. In this play of Plautus
and in all those of Terence the MSS. mark the Cantor by ω. The
actors are often indicated (asin B) by letters of the Greek alphabet3
the Cantor, therefore, who appeared at the end of all, is indicated by
the last letter of all.
