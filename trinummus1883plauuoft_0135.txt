IV. 2. 122-148, NOTES. LINES 930-990. 107

1. 964. vel. Cf. 655.

965. numeratum is usually considered as in apposition to nummum.

966. nempe. Cf. 196 note.

967. mirum quin. Cf. 495 note, 861.

968. cedodum. Cf. 98 note, 883.

971. eris. The archaic quantity of the -2‘s is here preserved before
the pause, though a vowel follows.

auro huic quidem, ‘ as far as this money is concerned indeed?

972. abi. Cf. 830 note.

975. post. Cf. 417 note.

977. charmidatu’s. With this word, coined from the proper name,
cf. Sullaturz'o, invented by Cicero. So Moliere makes Dorine‚ ban-
tering Mariane about her projected marriage with Tartuffe‚ say, Non,
vous screa, ma fhi, tartuffide ;' Le Tartuffe, Act ii. Sc. 3. The MSS.
concur in giving reclzarmz'da, but de is necessitated by the sense.

979. dum . . . ne are separated, as here, Capt. 3383 Aul. 4873
Livy 3. 21.

981. age, siquid agis, ‘if you have anything to do, do it.'

982. scriptum quidem, ‘yes, on paper,’ i.e. bills of exchange or
circular notes, useless to an impostor, such as Charmides is in the eyes
of the Sycophant. (This of course flatly contradicts the Sycophant's
statement in 965.) Plautus always refers to Greek, not Roman money,
and these bills of exchange from rich merchants seem to have been used
a good deal in Greek commerce. Real paper money, that is, a currency
without any intrinsic value whatever, was known to the Carthaginians

alone among the states of antiquity.
984. dormitator. Cf. 862 note.

985. quem ementitu’s‚ ‘ about whom you have made this pretence,'

not of course ‘ whom you have pretended to be.’
illum. Note the attraction to the case of the 1·elative; and for
the converse of this, cf. 137.

986. an is used here in the direct, as in 992 in the indirect question,
without any previous interrogation being expressed. It is always pos·
sible, however, to supply this interrogation from the general idea, as
here, nonne nugaris, an tu z's es' :9

988. ipsissumus. Suggested by Aristophanes, Plutus 83 ἐκεῖνος
αὐτός; αὐτότατος. 'Cf. gemz'nz'ssumzcs Pers. 5. 2. 49, and Poenz'or Poen.

- 5. 2. 31‚factz‘us 397.

989. abin hine. Cf. 457 note.

990. The Sycophant means 'that he as dominus gregis (the head of
a company of actors, and the only one not a slave) and the curule aediles
just entered upon office, will have Charmides flogged for his late appear-
