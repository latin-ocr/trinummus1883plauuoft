78 PLA VT] TRJNVMMVS. 11. 2. 18-37·

l. 299. capessere, ‘ take in hand,’ and so ‘ perform,’ like exsequi. Cf.
Virg. A. 1. 77 iussa capessere. For the form of the word, cf. 228 expe-
lessam.

tibi is ethic dative, ‘ as you should.'

302. servitutem servire. Verbs, transitive or intransitive, with
accusative of kindred meaning are very common in Plautus.

303. pro ingenio, ‘ as concerns my nature?

inperio tuo, i. e. the patria potestas.

306. utrum itane esse . . . an ita. Cf. Ter. Ad. utrum studione
id sibi habet an laudi putat fore, and Aul. 427, where Wagner gives a
number of examples. In such cases utrum has its proper signification,
‘ which of two ;’ and ne and an each introduce one of the altematives
thus suggested. The full form of the sentence can be seen in such a
passage as Cic. Verrin. 2. 4. 33 cogitare, utrum esset Agrigentinis utilius,
suisne servire, anne populo Romano obtemperare.

mavelit for malit, the only instance 3 but mavelim is very common
in Plautus.

308. si animus hominem pepulit. This follows 305 a little awk-
wardly ; but qm· is strictly the relative to hominem, homo being added to
the relative clause, because the antecedent follows a good deal further
down. Trans. ‘suppose that a man strives with his inclination, . . .
then, if inclination has overcome him?

309. eluet, ‘is famed,' like κλύω and audire. An archaic word. com-
mon in Plautus, but not found in Terence 3 very frequent in Lucretius.
Cf. 496 note, 620.

312. nimio satius, Cf. 34 note.

313. istaec, explained by the two following lines.

314. ubi esset damni conciliabulum, ‘to any gathering of prodi-
gals,' a meeting place where damnum is incurred. Cf. 553 and Cic.
Att. 9. 18 area sceleris, ⁴ a field where viee has free play.’ ”

penetrarem me. Cf. 276 note.
315. obambulatum, ‘to rove about,‘ i. e. for purposes of revelry.
suom alteri. Cf. 156.

316. parsi (= peperci), followed by ne and subjunctive, instead of

the usual infinitive.
sedulo. Cf. 192 note.

317. ‘By the discreetness of my conduct, Ι have always kept your
rules without a breach.’ When the Censors arranged sor the repair of
the public buildings, the contractors were bound to make them sarta
(et) tecta, lit. ‘ repaired and roosed.’

318. exprobras Originally meaning ‘to reproach ;’ this word gets the
signification, as here, of ‘ make trouble‚’ ‘ make a fuss about anything.’
