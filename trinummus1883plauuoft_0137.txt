IV. 3. 1-17· NOTES. LINES 990-1023. 109

1. 1010. ‘ step out, hurry up 3 it is long since you have left horne?

1011. cottabi. As the noise of the falling wine was the chief feature
of the Greek game of κότταβος, Stasimus uses the word to represent the
cowhide falling on his shoulders. The effect is greatly heightened by
the alliteration.

1013. satin. Cf. 925 note. thermopolium is the Greek θερμοπώλιον,
but thermopotare is a hybrid word, got from the Latin polare (observe
the difference of quantity), Some vulgarism, such as ‘ swilling-shop'
and ‘ swilled ’ may serve for translation.

1014. gutturem, masculine, as in the two other passages where
Plautus uses the word, Mil. 835, Aul. 302. Cf. papaverem 410.

1015. recurre petere. The infinitive is often used by Plautus after
verbs of motion. Terence has it after mittere. Eun. 528.

re recenti. ‘ While the loss is still fresh.’

1016. gurguliost exereit0r‚ ‘has his gullet for driver,’ i. e. he stag-
gers about like a drunken man.

1017. tribusne te poteriis, etc„ ‘(are you not ashamed) to have
lost your memory after three glasses ?' poterium is the Gr. ποτήριον.

1018. Most editors place 1022 before 1020, 1021. The order of the
MSS. (given in the text) may be kept, if we consider 1020, 1021, as
parenthetical. Stasimus, who is partly drunk, goes off into reflec'tions
about the frugi homines, before he completes the construction. The
hiatus after oblitum can be explained by the stop.

1020. ‘ mose-fist, CocktaiL Catch-crumb, Crib-ring‚ Cakeling, Clatter·
necks‚ Clatter-shins.' These are comic names, which Stasimus invents
for his companions.

chjruchus :6 χεῖρας ἔχων.

Cerconjcus is from κέρκος (3 tan), and νικάω, a compound to
which no very obvious sense seems to attach.

Crinnus may be κρίμνον, ‘ a crumb‚’ by assimilation of m, though
κρίνον (a lily> is given by Pollux, a writer of the second century A.D.‚ as
an equivalent for a needy man.

collabus (κόλλαβοςε ‘ a small cake '), is best suited to the former.

Grieolabus = ὃ κρίκον (ring) λαβών.

1021. cofficrepidae, erurierepidae, ‘men‚ whose necks and legs
rattle with chains! These are ἅπαξ λεὙ. ; as also ferriteri, ‘ men, who
are galled with setters’ (ferrum-tero).

1022. For the position of -ne‚ cf. 375 note.

postulas, Cf. 237 note.

1023. unUS, ‘anyone.'

surpuerit = subrupuerz't. Cf. 83.

solum, ‘ shoe sole.‘ Cf. Bacch. 332.
