Vulgate. It is very imperfect. Many pages are entirely lost¹,
several are all but illegible. Ritschl describes it as ‘abominably
washed out and scraped, blotted out by the later writing to an
extraordinary degree, cankered, worm-eamn, its leaves moulder-
ing and stuck together from neglect and damp, lastly to a great
degree miserably mutilated.’

Codices B, C, and D have all been corrected by a second, if
not by 3 third hand, and all are probably derived from one
original—C and D being contemporary transcriptS.

That there have been a good many omissions in the existing
MSS. is proved by the quotations which are found in other
writers but not in the plays themselves ; the corruptions which
have crept in (especially in B) are numerous and often absurd ;
and there can be little doubt that not a few lines have been
interpolated.

One reason of the scarcity and corruption of Plautine MSS.
is that the early comedies were not published in a literary sense
at all. The author was paid so much for translating a play, just
as the Choragus was paid so much for dressing it—with one
important dffference, namely that the pay of the author de-
pended on the success of his piece. Consequently the only
copies in existence would be actors⁷ copies, and these would
naturally become corrupted by glosses, interpolations, and
omissions.

Since, therefore, the MSS. are s0 few and their authority so
uncertain, critical emendations of the text for interna] reasons
have more justification than otherwise could be the case—espe-
cially where A fails ; indeed a strict conservatism is soon found
to be wholly impossible.

l Of the 1189 lines of the Trinummus no less than 558 are lost,
viz. 967171, 568-636, 672-735, 774-835‚ 864—1045, 1079-1189.
