76 PLA VT] TRJNVMMVS. 11. 1. 33-2· 9.

Lysiteles cornically proposes to have a formal and legal separation
from Love.

l. 267. fuas. The archaic forms suam, suas, fuat, fuant, are all used
by Plautus ; fuat occurs even in Virgil A. 10. 108. Cf. 76 note.

269. obnoxios, lit. ‘punishable‚' and so under obligation. Trans.
‘ whom you have made your subjects.’

270. certa res est, ‘ I am resolved.' Cf. 511.

ad frugem adplicare animum, ‘ to devote myself to virtue.'
Cf. 118 note.

274. magis-potius: a pleonasm. Cf. 1029; magis with a com·
parative adjective is often found in Plautus, e. g. magis certius Capt.
644. So μᾶλλον in Greek.

275. vanffliois, a word coined by Plautus, probably from μωρολόγος.
So 770 falsidicus = ψευδολόγοε, 100 turpilucricupidus = αἰσχροκερδής.

ACT ΙΙ. SCENE 2.

Lysiteles endures patiently a moral discourse from his father, protests
his own obedience and steadiness‚ and thereby induces the latter to
allow, and even to forward, his marriage with the sister of Lesbonicus.

Line 276. fflio. Cf. 3 note.
se penetravit. This reflexive use (cf. 291, 314) is adhered to by
Plautus with one exception, but the verb is intransitive in the Augustan
writers. Contrast se expedire 2 36 note.

277. neque ero in mora tibi=neque ero tibi morae. Cf. Ter. And.
467 ne in mora illi sis.

280. If the stopping is correct (Brix places the full stop after pietatem,
of course taking percoles per pietatem together) there is an anacoluthon,
as tuam per pietatem would be naturally followed by oro or obsecro in-
stead of nolo.

282. neoullum‚ simply=72ullum; nec had originally the same sense
as non, as may be seen in the expression res nec mancipi. Notice that
every part of this sentence is negatived, the verb, the object, and the
adverbial phrases z‘n via, infero, just as is common in Greek. Philto
thus emphasizes each point.

sermonem exsequi, ‘hold converse.’

284. similis, like consz'mz'lzs, dissimilis, always with genitive in
Plautus and Terence.

285. turbant miscent. The asyndeton adds force to the expression,
as in 243· This figure is very common in Plautus, e. g. 287 dies noctes,
302 inperiis praeceptis, 317 sarta tecta.
