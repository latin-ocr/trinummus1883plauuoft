xiv JNTRODUCTJON.

of the publica negotia (331), of the Cluentes (471), of the Syrian
and Campanian slaves (542, 545), of the dialect of Praeneste
(609), of the dictator (695), of Neptune (820), of the aediles
(990), of the punishment of crucifixion (1040). Set by the side
of these the mention of nummi Philippei (152), of the thousand
drachmae, owed to the banker Olympicus (425), of the two (not
three) guests on a couch at dinner (469), of bills of exchange
(982), of silver minae (1082), of the Piraeus, which Stasimus is
to reach without stopping (1103). To these we must add the
genuine Greek words employed, παῦσαι (117), οἴχεται (419),
πάλιν (705), ἐπιθήκη (1025). Very similar, again, are Greek words
adopted into Latin, graplzz‘cas (1024), with its adverb graphice
(770), thermopolium (1013) with the barbarous thermopfftare
(1014), poterium (1017), basilicus (1030). Note too words plainly
coined from the Greek, lmpz'lacricupidus (100), vanidicus (275),
falsidicus (770).

But, on the other hand, Plautus is thoroughly national and
original in the most striking characteristic of his dramas, in
plays upon words, in alliteration and assonance, and in asyn-
deta. These were not, and indeed could not be, taken from
any foreign source3 firstly, because they did not exist in the
Greek writers, from whom Roman Comedy borrowed3 and
secondly, it would be as difficult to produce them by translation,
as to maintain a long conversation in a whisper. It may be
worth while to cite the most striking instances. We find invitus
ni id me invitet (27), raptores panis et peni (254), pol pudere
quam pigere praestat (345), a fine example of alliteration and
assonance combined, inmoenis and maenus (354), vi Veneris
vincias (6 58), mores honzinum moros et morosos ejfficit (669), laetus
lubens laudes ago (821),besides 1003—4, 1011, and many others.
Asyndeton is common enough, e.g. labitur liquitur (242), in-
periis praeceptis (302), sarta tecta (317), mutmnst tacet (1005).
Metaphors too must grow up naturally in a language3 they
would be unintelligible if they were imported into it; and so
we have either those which might belong to any language, e.g.
love driving the lover into the 10115 (237), and the description
