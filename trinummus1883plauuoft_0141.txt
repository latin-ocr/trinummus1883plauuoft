trayed his trust, can scarcely be converted by one line (1096) notwith-
standing its even superfluous emphasis3 and yet he begins 1098 with
credo. It would seem, therefore, that some lines have dropped out, in
which Callicles explains his acts. It is, however, just worthy of
suggestion, that the explanation may have been given by a conversation
aside, seen but unheard by the audience, who might be occupied with
some by-play of Stasimus. We have heard Callicles defend himself in
the first act of the play, and we do not want a reproduction of his dia-
logue with Megaronides. This would present a difficulty which Plautus
may have been anxious to avoid. The digging up of the treasure for
the dowry is dismissed just below in one line and a half.

1099. sed quis est tuos ornatus P ‘ but why attired thus ?’ i. e.
pallium off, and perhaps spade in hand, as traditionally represented.

1103. unum curriculum face, i. e. ‘do not stop on the way,‘ as we
might say, ⁶ do it at a single stretch.’

face. Cf. 800 note.

1105. Sangarionem, some servant of Charmides.

1106. simul, i. e. with Sagario.

1107. portitori. Cf. 794 note.

1109. illic sum atque hic sum, ‘1 am there and back again,' an
emphatic way of saying ‘ 1’11 lose no time.'

1112. The MSS. here are confused and corrupt. The words liberos
absentis mez' eri are a mere conjecture to fill up a gap.

ACT V. SCENE 1.

Lysiteles congratulates himself on his good fortune, and, having heard
of the arrival of Charmides, determines to obtain from him a formal

sanction of his marriage.

Line 1115. hic homo. Cf. 172 note. In omnium the last tw
lables are joined by synizesis and elided.

1116. antepotens, ⁴ pre-eminent‚’ ἅπαξ λεγ.

1 118. Here the MSS. give quod ago, adsequitur, subest, subsequitur,
a hopeless line, which ought to be removed or rewritten. Ritschl‚
adopting the latter course, produces quod αὲο, subit, adsecue sequitur.

’ q adsecue is coined by himself.

1119. ‘So joys are heaped on joys.’
1122. quae (neuter plural), used loosely for quam, as εἰ rez' is
