80 PLA VTI TRJNIAEWMVS. II. 2. 63—78.

1. 344. deiuvare, ἅπαξ λεγ.

345. ‘Indeed shaming is better than blaming oneself by every letter
of the word.’ A strong way of asserting that pudere is in every way
better than pigere. To translate ‘though the number of letters is the
same,' is possible, but lacks point.

348. ut pudeat, must be explained by the general sense of the pre-
ceding words : ‘ do not blame yourself for having aided a friend ; (blame
yourself so little) that you rather feel shame,‘ etc.

350. inmoeni (rather than inmuni here as well as in 243 but not
even there is it warranted by the MSS.; Lucretius has moenera three
times). This word has three meanings in the play, (Ι) ‘which gets no
mammas i. e. ‘thankless‚' in 24; (2) ‘who gives no moenera‚' i. e.
‘stingy‚' in 3503 (3) ‘who does no moenera’ (duties), in 354. In the
last two there is a play on the double sense of the word: ‘ do you know
the lines so often quoted at the man who will part with nothing‚' and
then 3 54: ‘ he has no part in life who has not the wherewithal to per-
form his part.’

cantari. Cf. 2873 but perhaps here there is some notion of
quoting a song.

solet„ Colloquial use. In other than eomic writers the syntax
would demand the subjunctive.

351. ‘ May you want your riches, and be rich only in your wantS.’
A. gives velim malum. Both words cannot stand. If the latter is
adopted, it ean be taken with illud, or, as a vocative, ‘wretch ;’ but it
looks very like the addition of some commentator to explain the phrase
quod non habes.

352. pote :potes here, and in a few more instances in Plautus. It
seems to be found also for posse. Pate for potest is very common in
Latin. See Munro, Lucr. 5. 836.

354. moenus fungatur. Cf. 1 note.

qui, ablative.

356. comitati simus, ‘ be liberal,' as in 333. For the construction
cf. usuz' esse, etc.

358. For the hiatus after quoi ef. 604.

359. hine. Cf. 326 note.

Charmidai. This form of the genitive is found in Plautus,
for proper names in -ες, for nouns of the first declension in -a
(often), and occasionally for the feminine adjective, e. g. magnai
Mil. 103. Terence has no instance of it. See Parry on Terence
And. 2. 6. 8. (439). Lucretius uses it for the substantive very
often; for the adjective three times. Virgil has aulai, aurai, aquai,
pictai.
