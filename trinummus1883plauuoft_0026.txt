xxii JAJ’TRODUCTJON.

Any monosyllabic preposition may be shortened by dropping
its final consonant, eg. ab and ad may be scanned ἔι, ex as 6,
etc. Final ἐὶ, e, i, ὃ, 316 311 occasionally shortened both in
nouns and verbs.

II. The shortening of an unaccented syllable in order to
throw all the stress on the accented syllable is thus expressed
in a formula by Wagner ψ-Δ = ψψ-’ῑ and in trochaics -fv- =
Luc)- This occurs most frequently at the beginning of a verse.
Instances are serffntdrz'um 456, volzintcite 1166, quid tibi inte'r-
pellatia 709, palisi fz'erz‘ 730, tabffrndculo 726, dedistz'n 129, sz'
mage exegere 1052, sed istzic 88, quid i‘stz'c 57 3, lzz'c quoque lzinc
cibz‘z‘t 718, quia amne& 78. Brix and Wagner maintain that inde
and finde may be shortened, even when standing at the begin-
ning of a line in trochaic metre.

ΙΙΙ. Synizesis. Any case of mem, tuus, suus may be mono—
syllabic—in fact almost any two vowels coming together may

be thus contracted: e. g. ez, 0⁷2ch, eorum, aas, re-z, dms, α’ἵές,
cle—os, &o

To show how greatly scansion depended on accent eius, huius,
quoius, are indifferently used as trochees, pyrrhics, or mono-
syllables. Compounds in which two vowels come together are
regularly contracted, e.g. ere-O'ptare. Double letters were prob-
ably not written in the time of Plautus, and consequently vowels
when unaccented are freely shortened before double consonants:
deculto 712, decepisti 964, satalites 833, Philippicas 152.

Archaic long terminations are occasionally retained by Plautus
(rarely by Terence) where the rhythm of the verse requires thern:
e.g.famz'lz‘d (nom. sing.) 251 3—0'r (ωρ) in nom. sing. of nouns
and comparative adjectives 226 3—l7us in dat. and abl. plur; and
the verb endings is (eis), at (ait), e‘t (eit), ῖί (z'z't) : cf. 206. Es
(from sum) is always long in Plautus.

Hiatus is generally acknowledged to be admitted by Plautus,

(1) 'Where the line is divided among two or more speakers,
e.g. 432 3

(2) Where there is a distinct pause in the sense, e. g. 185, 1018;
