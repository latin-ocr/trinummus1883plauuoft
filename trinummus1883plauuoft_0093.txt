I. 2. 27-49. NOTES. LINES 49-86. 65

1. 65. ut, bene vivitur, diu vivitur. Callicles closes these bantering
remarks with a moral platitude: ‘Well truly, according as one lives
virtuously one lives long.’ Cf. Seneca de Brevitate Vitae, cap. 8 Non
est quod quenquam propter canos aut rugas putes diu vixisse: non ille

diu vixit sed diu fuit. Most of the modern editors transpose bene and
diu, against the MSS.

67. quid= ‘ why?’

68. obiurgitem. Ritschl reads obiurzgrem (an older form of obiurga)
from the reading of A, OBIVR. .EM. It is very seldom that a
substantive is found with two epithets unconnected by any conjunctim,
as here. Cf. 1045.

72. aegrotant. Cf. 30. artes, ‘qualities.' antiquae. Cf. Ter. Ad.
442 homo . . . antiqua virtute et fide. In the MSS. follow these three
lines (except in A, which has not the first line at all)—

Sin immutare vis ingenium moribus

Aut si demutant mores ingenium tuum,

Neque eos antiquos servas ast captas novos.
These lines are rejected as interpolations by Ritschl, Brix, and Wagner.
The first is not found in A; the second and third merely repeat in other
words the idea expressed in 72. See Introduction on Plautine MSS.
and note on 48.

76. videre audireque aegroti, ‘sick at seeing and hearing you ;’ a
rare construction, imitated from the Greek, and known as the epexegetic
infinitive. Cf. Merc. 4. 5. 3 Defessus sum urbem totam pervenarz'er.

sient archaic form of sint. Plautus also uses siem, sies, siet. Cf.
267 note. ’
77. quj, see 14, note. ist-aee, cf. hercle 58, i'stuc 88.
78. quia omnis, scanned as a single foot.
ad-eurare ad-deeet. Plautus is fond of such strengthened forms:
addecet for decet is found only in Plautus and Ennius.

80. non potest, scanned as one foot. For potest used impersonally
‘it is possible,’ cf. 7 31; Ter. Phor. 303.

81. promus (deriV. prom0); he who gives out provisions etc.; a
steward or butler. ‘ 1 keep the key of my own breast?

83. subrupuisse, archaic for surripuisse.

84. On the use of local Roman allusions by Plautus, see Introduction.

85. columine, archaic for culmine. A statue of Jupiter Triumphator
.cr0wned with laurel stood on the highest part of the Capitol. Cf.
Men. 941. ,

86. suspicarier, archaic for suspicari. This was probably the
original termination of the passive infinitive‚ formed by the addition of
er, as the sign of the passive, to the active infinitive, the final e being
