ance, a practice alluded to in the epilogue to the Cistellaria, Later,
however, it must have fallen into disuse 3 for we hear (Tac. Ann. Ι. 77)
that a proposal to flog actors was made in the reign of Tiberius, and
met by a dictum of Augustus, immunes verberum histriones. The
‘ new aediles ’ must mean the aediles who had lately entered upon office
in March ; and so Ritschl proves from this passage that the Trinummus
was acted at the Ludi Megalenses, which took place on the fourth of
April and the five following days. These games did not include stage
plays till B.C. 194, as stated by Livy, 34. 54. Therefore the Trinummus
was not acted earlier than this date.

1. 990. meo arbit-ratu. Cf. 1 140 meo datu. The hiatus after arbitratu
is justified by the break in the line, which occurs at this point.

992. ‘May Ι drop down dead if Ι care a straw if you had been
drowned on the way? This is said παρὰ προσδοκίαν, as the Sycophant
has begun with 'the usual formula for a good wish. So in 997 perdant
takes the place of the natural servent. Cf. 72 3. and foll.

993. te macto infortunio, ‘my curse go with you.‘ Cf. Ter. Phor.
1028.

994. interduim, an archaic form only in Plautus. Cf. duint 436. .

997. qui, as in 923.

998. post: 417 note. After this exciting dialogue Charmides finds
relies in sober iambies.

1000. acmen& ‘ sharp anxiety.’

1002. concenturiant, ‘gather whole battalions of fear.’ Note the
military metaphor, so common in Plautus, used in a somewhat comic
sense.

1003. quam rem agat, ‘what it. means‚’ i.e. the mille nummum.
Nothing is gained by changing this, the reading of the MSS„ into agant.
Charmides is not so much concerned about the letters.

1004. tinnit, tintinnabulum. Note the jingle of these two ono-
matopoeic words.

1005. nisi qui. Cf. 439 note.

1006. in plateam. Cf. 840 note.

ACT IV. SCENE 3.

Stasimus, after a half-drunken soliloquy, is recognised by his master,
whom he informs of the sale of his house.

Line 1008. fao te propere celerem, ‘ make all haste,' an emphatic
tautology.
1009. scapulis, dativus incommodi.
