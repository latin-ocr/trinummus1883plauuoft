INTRODUCTJON. xxiii

(3) In the case of monosyllables ending in a long vowel or
m, e. g. em 603, quoi 3 58, 604, 8763

(4) In the break at the end of the 4th foot of Trochaic Tetra-
meters‚ e.g. 990.

Wagner would also admit hiatus before a cretic at the end of

a senarius, e.g. alternae arbores, the MS. reading in 5 39.
’ Pro-efision is very frequent in Plautus with es and est, cf.
homo's 447, consz'lz'st 763 : it is less common with other words,
cf. ne (e)g0 433, sz' (ι’)ία 1098. These latter may, however, be
considered as cases of Crasis.

A long final vowel is sometimes shortened and not elided
before another vowel or lz, cf. tzZ lzomds 447.

Two syllables connected by v may, in certain words (e. g.
boves, oves, aves), be contracted into one; navem is a mono-
syllable 835, cf. ναῦν. Compare the story told by Cicero de Div.,
2, 40, 84, where Cauneas ( sc. ficus), as called out by hucksters‚
is identical in pronunciation with cave ne eas. Cf. Plaut. Truc.
3, 2, 15; Ritschl. Prol. L. ’

Α dissyllable is not unfrequently contracted by Synizesis and
then altogether elided‚ e. g. 119 εἶ νζεί) offeram.
