1. 819. actum reddam, ‘ Ι will get it done.'
nugacissume‚ ‘ most craftily.' The word is a conjectural restor-
ation from the corrupt reading of the MSS.

ACT IV. SCENE 1.

Charmides, the father of Lesbonicus, appears on his way from the
Piraeus, where he has just landed after a stormy passage from Asia.
He offers up thanks for his safe return, and is about to enter his house
when his attention is arrested'by the Sycophant‚ whom Megaronides has
already dressed out as a foreigner, and duly instructed.

This scene is believed to be written in Trochaic metre (octonarii) by
Ritschl; others have considered it as anapaestic.

Line 820. The reading of the MSS. is here very corrupt.
salipotenti‚ ἅπαξ λεγ., ‘ he that rules over the salt sea.’
821. Notice the alliteration. He cannot find words enough to ex-
press his thankfulness.
822. quos penes. For a similar anastrophe, i. e. inversion of order,
cf. 1146.
quid foret, epexegetieal of mei potestas, lit. ‘as to what might
happen to.’
823. quom. Cf. 505.
suis ex locis, i. e. from the sea.
usque should be taken with in patriam urbem.
826. spureificum, ἅπαξ hey„ lit. ‘ making filthy‚' ‘revolting.'
eontra oper-5. expertus (sum), ‘ Ι have found it otherwise by
experience3' for operci cf. Bacch. 387; Capt. 425.
827. eo modo ut volui=quo modo volui. Cf. 662.

972; Ter. Ad. 564, 765·
scis tractare, ‘you know how to treat.’
ordine, ‘ as befits their rank.'
831. A mutilated fragment of a line, which gives no good sense, is
here read in the MSS.
832. absque te=sine te. Plautus and Terence only use absque in
. conditional sentences; the word is not used by any Augustan writer ex-
cept a few times in quasi-juridicial formulae, e. g. absque sententia,
‘without judgment.' Cf. 11²7·
833. disque tulissent. For other cases of tmesis cf. Ter. And. 6 3
cum quibus erat cumque5 ib. 263, 455, 486.
