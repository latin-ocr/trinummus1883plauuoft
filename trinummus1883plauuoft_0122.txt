94 PLA VT] TRJNVMMVS. ΠΙ. 2. 16-38.

1. 642. itan tandem . . , ‘ was it for this, pray, that.' . . . For tandem
in indignant questions cf. Cic. Cat. 1. 1 sub init, quousque tandem
abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra ,9

643. anteperta=anteparta Cf. inpertire, refertus, repercere, aequi-
perare. Cf. 466, 1126.

644. vindex, a difficult word in this connexion. Vindex may mean
‘ one who takes vengeance on another‚' so ‘one who destroys another.'
Cf. Sall. Cat. 5 5 ξ 5, where it is said of the Τ res viri rerum capitalium
who executed the sentences on the conspirators, vindices rerum capita-

lium laqueo gulam fregere. G. Valla similarly explains the passage,
ut ulciscaris ac J'ugules honorem qui venturus erat ad posteros. Cf.

Brix ad loc. So vindex here =⁶ executioner,' ‘destroyer.' Many readings
have been proposed to evade the difficulty, e. g. vibex, index, inlex,
vendax (lionoris), tu obex.

645. Notice the emphatic position of tibi, and the frequent repetition
of cases of tu and tuus in this outburst of Lysiteles.

648. pra-e-optavisti, only here followed by ut with the subjunctive.

653. qui, ablative.

655. vel exsignavem, ⁶ and I would even set my'seal to a record of
it.’ Cf. 775, 788, 794. The tense may be explained, ‘I will at once do
so (cf. 6ο note) if required.’

656. ut, etc.‚ is explanatory. Cf. istaec.

657. utzqualem. Cf. 46 note.

658. athS, perfect participle passive, from old verb apo, ‘ Ι bind.’

fraudem = culpam.

659. The MSS. read summas liabeo gratias: but <gratia is so generally
used in the singular with habere, that several editors have altered the
reading.

661. me piget, etc., ⁶ Ι am grieved that you have too little sense of
shame.' Cf. 697.

662. postremo. Cf. 613.
mi auscultas, ‘you listen to me‚’ i.e. obey me. In this sense

auscultare governs a dative; meaning simply ‘to hear,’ it governs an

accusatlve.
663. tute pone te latebis, ‘ you will stand in your own light? The

idea is that the higher and better self, which wills to do right, will be
obscured by the lower and more sensual passions which bid fair to
destroy all sense of shame and honour. There may be an allusion to a
practice of the scurrae (cf. 202) mentioned Poen. 3. 2. 35 faciunt
scurrae quod consuerunt ; pone sese homines locant ; meaning by homines
their parasites or umbrae.

664. maxume is connected with voles. Supply esse before clarum.
