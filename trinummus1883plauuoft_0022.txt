approach of Lysiteles and Lesbonicus, both much agitated.
An animated dialogue follows,

Aet, ΠΙ. So. 2. Lysiteles endeavours to prevail on Lesbon-
icus not to insist upon the dowry : he forcibly depicts the im-
pending ruin of the family3 but Lesbonicus is proud and obsti-
nate : he cannot endure the thought of what his fellow-citizens
might say, were his sister, without a penny of her own, to marry
so rich a man ; and at last breaks away abruptly, followed by
Lysiteles, Stasimus being left alone to paint in a few graphic
touches his probable future as a soldier⁷s man-of-all-work.

Aet ΠΙ. So. 3. Meanwhile Callicles, acting on the advice
of Megaronides, determines to provide a dowry for the young
lady from the hidden treasure. The difficulty is how to do
so without arousing the suspicions of Lesbonicus, who would
quickly make away with the remaining money if he became
aware of its existence. Megaronides hits on the following
device. A man is to be hired to personate a messenger from
Charmides. The impostor is to pretend that he brings letters
and a remittance in money for Callicles; and then all will be
easily done. This plan is at once carried into effect.

Aet IV. Se. 1. Charmides, however, unexpectedly appears
in person, havingjust lauded at the Piraeus after a bad passage.
He dilates in some sonorous lines on the perils of the deep, and
is just about to enter his house when he encounters the sham mes-
senger, the Sycophant, enquiringssfor the house of Lesbonicus.

Aet IV. So. 2. In an amusing scene, Charmides, whose suspi—
cions are at once aroused, questions the Sycophant as to his name
and business. The Sycophant replies with evasive answers and
preposterous absurdities, though he makes no secret of his pre-
tended errand. When challenged he cannot give the name of‘his
friend' who had entrusted the ‘ 1000 gold pieces ² to his charge;
but even that only for a moment disturbs his self-assurance.

At length Charmides discloses his identity, and demands the
money. The Sycophant is at first incredulous, and when finally
convinced covers his retreat with brazen impudence.
