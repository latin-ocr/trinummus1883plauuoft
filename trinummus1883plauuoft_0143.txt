below, Cf. 990 meo arbitratu, which, however, is common, and often
found in Cicero.

1. 1144. a me, ‘from my own means? Cf. 328 note.

1145. qui, ‘ anyhOW.'

rom ipsam, ‘ the truth‚’ explained by the following clause.

1148. quin. So in 932·

1154. tunica propior palliost, a proverb, to which no satisfactory
equivalent seems to exist in English.

1156. nevis, Cf. 328 note.

1158. auri=aurezcm (1139), as in French ‘ mille louis d'or.’

dotem nil moror. Cf. 511, 297 note.

1159. placenda, a peculiar use of the gerundive‚ in the same sense
as the active placere. Cf. 264 abstandus and note. It is possible that
placet and placenda were suggested to Plautus by some Greek words,
e. g. ἀρέσκει and ἀρεστός, the gerundive being an apparent translation of
the verbal adjective. So, too, abstandus might be got from ἀποστατέον,

1160. feres, ‘ take with it.'

1161. ius hie orat, ‘his plea is just.' Lysiteles in his reply keeps
up the legal character of the phrase. Oro in old Latin=dicere; this
phrase, therefore, is not quite the same as impetis Ps. 1313 ; z'us orare
however, does not= z‘us dicere, which was technically used of the Praetor
pronouncing judgment.

1163. adfines mei. Callicles as well as Charmides makes himself a
party to the sponsio; hence Lysiteles applies the term adfinis to
him also. ,

1166. Lysiteles implies that he is not to blame, though he does not
state it positively. But the singular brevity of his defence has led most
of the editors to assume a lacuna after this line.

1168. missa faeiaS, ‘condone.’

1171. leviorem, ‘ somewhat inconsiderate?

1175. ita subitumst, etc„ ‘ so urgent 15 my wish for a speedy inter-
view with him,’ lit. ⁵ that Ι wish him interviewed?

propere, probably with conventum, possibly with subitum. Cf.
1008.

ACT V. Sca-NE 3.

- Lesbonicus is pardoned by his father on condition of marrying the
γ daughter of Callicles.

Line 1177. salvae, sc. res sunt tuae.
1181. nihil, 56. laboris. Charmides cuts short his son's remark

For the full phrase, cf. Ter. Haut. 82 sz' quid laborist, nollem.
