102 PLA VTI TRINVMMVS IV, 1, 16-42-

l. 83 5. quasi—haud secus3 for the tautology cf. 756 note.

836. fremere, etc„ the historic infinitive, making the description
more vivid.

837. ruere in the transitive sense is rare even in poetry; not found
in Classical prose (with one doubtful exception, Cic. Att. 2. 15. 2), ex-
cept in the past participle ratus. Cf. Ter. Ad. 3193 Virg. A. i. 85, and
in five other passages.

ni paz, etc„ is a repetition in altered form of the protasis in 832
nam absque foret te; the lines ita quasi canes to scindere vela being
a descriptive parenthesis.

838. The connection of thought is: ‘ by the special favour of Nep-
tune (for which all thanks be given), I have escaped from the perils of
the sea ; but no more tempting of Providence for me.’

apage a me sis ( :si vis), ‘away with it from me, if you please.'
Cf. 972.

8 39. dehinc jam = jam posthac.

838-9. The order is satis partum habeo eis aerumnis quibus deluctavz'.

839. deluctavi. A collateral active form of deluctor, as lucto of luctor.

840. simul, i. e. ‘at the same time as myself.’ Charmides and the
Sycophant are supposed to approach the house at the same moment,
Charmides stepping back when he sees the strange-looking man peering
about. The stage in the Roman Comedy was always supposed to be an
open place where four streets met3 so that two actors could be seen and
heard by the audience when they were out of sight and sometimes out of
hearing of one another.

841. cupio domi :cupidus sum domi, Gr. ἐπιθυμῶ οἴκου. For domi,
cf. 102 7. This form of the genitive was always used by the comic poets‚
domzzs always by Augustan writers.

840—2. The text, following Brix with A, divides 840-2 into four
lines—three anapaestic dimeters and a versus paroemiacus; as is so often
found in a Greek chorus before the entrance of a new character. This,
however, is rejected by Ritschl, who pronounces them to be two trochaic
octonarii, as the rest of the Scene, and places simul before animum
instead of after specieque where it stands in A.

ACT IV. SCENE 2.

The Sycophant soliloquises on his position, not seeing Charmides,
whose suspicions are at once aroused. An amusing scene follows. Char-
mides tries to find out the meaning of the evident imposture3 the Syc0-›
phant indulges in travellers' tales of outrageous absurdity3 but when
