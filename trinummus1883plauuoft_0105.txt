ΙΙ. 2.10—16. NOTES. LINES 267-297. 77

mores is the accusative. The three singular adjectives are par-
ticular instances of mali.

l. 286. hiulca germ, ‘ insatiate horde,’ referring to the rapax, etc.

287. canto, ‘ harp on.’ Cf. Ter. Phor. 495 cantilenam eandem canis.
Note the frequentative force. and cf. 3 50 cantari.

288. quo manus abstineant. The natural construction would be
eo manus abstinere. Here the relative clause follows fas, just as if it
were some such adjective as dignus or idoneus.

289. The four imperatives are addressed to the hiulca gens.

290. quja duravi depends on lacrumas eliciunt, the indicative here
stating the fact, which is also the true reason. Non quia with the
indicative expresses a fact, which is not, however, the reason; non
quod with the subjunctive denies both fact and reason.

291. quin, ‘why not.’ The following are the chief uses of quin in
the comic poets :—

(1) ‘why not‚’ either directly as here, or indirectly as in 495.

(2) with imperativeS. Cf. 582 quin tu ι’ modo. This arose from
the use with the second person of the present indicative where the sense
is equivalent to that of an imperative. Cf. 1 [8 note.

(3) ‘because not.’ Cf. 341.

(4) in the common sense ‘ but that ' after verbs expressing preven-
tion, doubt, and the like with a negative.

(5) a corroborative particle, ‘ indeed? ‘verily.’ Cf. 932.

plures, ‘the departed‚’ lit. ‘the majority.’ Greek οἱ πλείονες, an
euphemistic expression, like οῖ κεκμηῶτες Thuc. 3. 59.

me penetravi. Cf. 276 note.

292. lutitant, ‘ sully’ (lutum, ‘mud'). Cf. 693 conlutulentet. Both
words are ἅπαξ λεγ.

293. gratiam facio (‘make a favour ⁹), is not unfrequently found with
gen. in the sense of to ⁴ excuse ' or ‘ pardon ' something. So rather awk-
wardly, but quite intelligibly, with ne and subjunctive. ‘ In the matter of
these pursuits Ι readily excuse you from training your young mind there-
with.’ This is a mild way of warning Lysiteles against them.

artibus. Cf. 72. '

imbuo means ‘to act upon early in any way? Cf. Virg. A. 7. 542
sanguine bellum z'mbuz't‚‘ shed the first blood of battle ;' Ovid A. A. 1. 654
infelix imbuit auctor opus, ‘the hapless maker inaugurates his own work.'

297. moror with negative: ‘to let a thing go by,' hence ‘not to
value‚’ ‘have no liking for.' Cf. 511, and Virg. A. 5. 400 nec dona
moror, ‘ nor are gifts what I care for.’ In 337 below it is followed by
accusative and infinitive.

faecem, ‘ foul? ἅπαξ λεγ. Cf. lutitant 29²-
