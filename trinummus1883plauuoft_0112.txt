84 PLA VTJ TRJNVMMVS. ΙΙ. 4. 25-54.

1. 426. quas de ratione debuisti, ‘for which you had overdrawn‚'

lit. ⁶ which you owed according to the account)
dehibuisti, which has some MS authority, may be the right read-
ing, as delziheo must have been the original form of debeo.

427. despondeo, which means (ι) ‘to promise;' (2) ‘to give up,'
(e. g. animum despondeat, Mil. 6) here has the special sense of ‘get rid
of by promising.' Trans. ‘then there is the secursty, which Ι was
pledged to pay. ST. Say rather, “ was pledged and paid.’⁷ '

428. aibas. This form of the imperfect is read here and in 874, 944,
1140, where the MSS. give aiebam but the metre makes the change
necessary.

429. ut, ‘ so that, as a consequence of doing s0.’

433. ne. Cf. 62 note.

434. peculio. As Stasimus imagines Philto his slave, he logically
calls his property peculium, this being the regular term for the property
allowed by the master of the house to his son or slave.

436. duint. Cf. Ter. And. 666, Phor. 519. The archaic forms duim,
detis or duas, duit, duint, are all used by Plautus. For creduz'm, etc„
cf. 606 note.

438. bene volt, tibi, ‘ he is your well—wisher.’

439. nisi qui bene facit, ‘ except from a well-doer.'

nisi quizm'sz’ quis, as in 1005. Cf. 1032 nisi quod lubet, and 2 57
ubi qui.

441 . The former postulet is protasis, ‘ should he want to lead a steady
life, his want would be absurdss For the meaning of postulo cf.
237 note.

445. hau nosco tuom, ‘I do not recognise your wonted manner in
this,’ i. e. ‘this is quite unlike your ordinary kindness ;' cf. 12 3.

447. ita me amabit Iuppiter, ⁶ as I‘hope for the love of Iuppiter.'

448. dignum=aequ0m. Cf. Aul. 222.

449. hoo, in apposition to the following clause, ‘as Ι have said.'

451. ⁴ It is right that I should recognise the true position of my for-
tunes?

452. factio, commonly used for ‘political party,' and later for the
divisions of charioteers in the Roman games, here means the number of
friends and clients‚ who support a man. Cf. Aul. 225, wherefactz'osus
means a man strong in such support. The word recurs 467, 491, 497,
and perhaps may be translated ‘ connexion?

454. mentis aut animi. This construction is common in Plautus
and Terence, and used by later writers (e. g. Virg. G. 3. 289 dubius
animi). The case is most simply explained by supposing that it is the
locative. See Roby’s School Latin Grammar, 485. The use of mentis,
