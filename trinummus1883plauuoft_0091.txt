1.1.16-2.10. NOTES. LINES 23-48. 63

1. 37. odiossae, archaic for odiosae; the form arising by assimilation
from -onsus. Cf. 1077.

38. remoram, ‘hindrance,’ only found in ante· and post· classical
writers.

Sem-E 2.

Megaronides upbraids Callicles for his seeming breach of saith in
buying his friend’s house. Callicles in sels—defence is forced to reveal
the secret of the buried treasure.

Line 39. Larem. The household god was crowned with flowers on
the occasion of any festivity. This was a sort of ‘ house-warming ’ in
the newly-purchased residence.

41. bona, etc„ the regular formula in invoking good luck. Cf. Cic.
Div. Ι. 45. 102. Faustus :favostus, from faveo. Felix, from the ob-

solete feo, Gr. φύω, ‘to produce 3’ whence femina, fietus, fecundus, faenus.
Cf. Gr. τόκος.

evenat has been substituted for the MS. reading eveniat here
and in three other places in Plautus ; as also pervenat, evenant, advenat,
in all cases at the end of a line, metsi gratia.

43. senecta. Senectus as an adjective is only found in Plautus,
Lucretius, and the fragments of Sallust.

44. castigabilem‚ ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, ‘worthy to be punished.’ The
suffix -bz‘lz's or -z‘lis usually means ‘ easy to be done ;’ cf. conducibilis,
⁶ easy to be made profitable‚' utibilis, ‘easy to be used:’ rarely with

active signification. Cf. Virg. G„ Ι. 93; 7Βονεαε penetrabile frigam
Hor. Od.‚ I. 3. 22.

45. quoia=archaic form of cuja. hic is of course the adverb.

46. ita’s ut=talis es qualem (cf. 657). te sc. esse.

47. es is always long in Plautus.

48. Ritschl and most of the modern editors consider the words atque
aequalis, ut vales Megaronides to be a gloss, because—

(Ι) of the awkward hiatus after salve,

(2) of the disregard of the question by Megaronides,

(3) of the unusual position of the name Megaronides.
VVere the MSS. better and more numerous, words found in all could not
be thus rejected. But in the case of Plautus, probably the only MSS.
- in existence were actor's copies, and these would be very likely to have
emendations or amplifications of the text written on the margins, and by
later copyists incorporated with the text itself. The present words are
just such as an actor might have inserted in order to let the audience

lft'xliow the name of Megaronides. See Introduction on the MSS. of
autus.
