ACT II. SCENE 1.

In the following canticum or lyrical monologue Lysiteles describes
the troubles and extravagances of love, and declares his intention of
leading a sober life. Notwithstanding his earnestness, he feels that
moral sentiments sound a little out of character from his lips ; and this
makes him use odd, almost comic expressions, e. g. 266 tuas res tz'bz'
habeto, and 2 52-3, the enumeration of the familia.

Line 223. simitu, an old form equivalent to simul (similis, ἅμα),
occurs ten times in Plautus, and scarcely anywhere else. In two of
these places, Amph. 631, Most. 3. 2. 105, there is a metrical difficulty,
and Ritschl proposes the collateral form sz‘mz'tur, which is found in
inscriptions.

224. indipiscor, a compound of indu or endo and apiswn adzffl‘scor
being the common form in later Latin ; indaudz're (as well as z'naudz're)
is found in Plautus ; but this form of 2⁹72 is usually epic: indugredi, in-
duperator, etc„ are used by Lucretius, even indu manu (2. 1096) and
endo mari (6. 890). See Munro on Lucretius 1. 82. The active indi-
pz‘sco occurs Aul. 768 ; Asin. 279.

226. exercitor. The last syllable is long here ; and this must have
been the old usage, as is shown by the genitive -5722'5 and the Greek -ωρ,
Note the phrase magister exercitor (with which Wagner compares ἀνὴρ
στρατιώτης), the second noun adding a further description of the first,
and trans. ‘a hard task-master,’ the Greek‘vraffiorpc'fiqs, or superinten-
dent of exercises in the gymnasium.

228. artem, ‘principle of conduct,’ with which compare 74, artes
antiquae tuae, ‘your good old qualities,' and 2 36 amoris artes, ‘the de-
vices of love.'

expetessam‚ ‘ make my aim‚’ a word found only in Plautus.
230. rei scans as a spondee, as Lucr. 1. 688.
obsequi belongs more naturally to amori than to 7‘ez'3 but the
zeugma is not very pronounced‚ and the phrase is easily rendered ‘to
devote myself to love or business.’

231. This and the following line are found in all the MSS„ but are
now regarded as spurious by most of the commentators. They cer·

· tainly seem a· weak repetition of the three preceding lines, and vitae
and aetatem come awkwardly so close together.

233. nisi is often used in transitions somewhat abmpssy, a slight
ellipse being the explanation: ‘ I am not quite clear about the matter;
(or I shall not be clear) unless indeed I so act.’
