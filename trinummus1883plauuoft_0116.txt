88 PLA VT] TRINVMMVS. ΙΙ. 4.124-139.

l. 52 5. Acheruntis ostium= Orci janua, or in Homer Ἀΐδαο πὺλαι
(Wagner). Acheruns (=Aclzer0n) is Hades here, not the river as
in 494·

526. vinum=uva, while Horace, Od. 1. 20. 10, says tu bibes uvam.

527. eonsuadet, ⁴urges‚' i. e. not to accept the land; cf. 670.

etsi scelestus est, ‘ rascal though he is, he is still faithful to me‚’
i.e. whatever he is about is for my good. This use of at in the apo-
dosis is common.

529. post id. It is best to write this in two words. The forms
postidea and antidit (=a72teit 546) may prove that postid antid were
the original forms of the prepositions, but not that Plautus used them.

530. tribus tantis minus redit, ⁶ yields three times as much less:
So Bacch. 1034 sescenta tanta reddam, ‘ Ι will give back six hundred
times as much,' lit. ⁶ six hundred things as great.’

illi, old form for illic, often in Plautus and Terence, e. g. Phormio
91, where the metre makes the form certain.

531. This remark, like 545—552‚ is put into the mouth of Philto, as
an indication that he does not believe the story of Stasimus, though he
finds it convenient to affect belief.

532. interfieri. The only instance of this form of the passive
infinitive.

5 34. quorum, probable correction for quoium, ⁴ of those to whom
it has belonged’

5 35. exulatum: exolatum, the spelling warranted by A, may point
to the proposed derivation from ex -solum,

537. ut ad incitas redactust, ‘has no longer anywhere to turn.'
‘has not a move on the board,' lit. ‘has been reduced, as it were, to
immoveable calces,’ or checkmated ; calces, or more commonly the
diminutive calculi, were draughts, with Which the game was played, a
player losing if his pieces were in a position where they could not be
moved. Cf. Poen. 4. 2. 85, where the phrase occurs, and also unam
calcem ciere, ‘ to move a single piece.’

5 38. ex me, a correction for the MSS. a me, which is against general
usage, and easily accounted for by a me in the preceding line.

5 39. alternis, sc. vicibus, ‘ every other.‘ This is a correction for the
MSS. alternae, which is against the metre.

540. The MSS. agree in giving sues moriuntur angina acerrume,
which involves an awkward hiatus. It has been proposed to insert
acri, liic, or illi after angina. If either of the latter, acerrume might
be changed into acerruma, since acerrume mori is an odd phrase, though
aster all not very unnatural in the mouth of Stasimus. Ritschl reads an-
ginad. Cf. 35 note. The penultimate of angina is short (Greek ἀγχόνη).
