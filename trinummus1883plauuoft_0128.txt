1. 789. sui paterni anuli=sui patris anuli. Cf. 602 ; Mil. 135
apud paternum suom hospitem.

790. novisse. The connexion between this and the preceding clause
is somewhat loose. Instead of a future we have novisse, which makes
the statement a general one, referiing not solely to the special occasion
indicated by aczflret. Lesbonicus is already well acquainted with his
father’s signet, and so of course will be when the forged letters are
presented.

791. sescentae. Cf. 166 note.

793. iarn, ‘ further.'

794. portitores, ‘custom-house officer53’ Gr. πεντηκοστολόγοι. Cf.

sibi, because the Sycophant is the logical subject of dici hoc
potest.

797. quamvis longi. Cf. 380 note.

texier. Cf. 86 note3 and the Homeric phrase μύθους ὑφαίνειν.

798. clanculum =clam, with a diminutive termination 3 once found as
a preposition with accusative. Ter. Ad. 52.

799. ancillas, the ordinary feminine coiresponding to servus.

800. eampse = ipsam. as ipse = z's-pse or z's-pte. So we find in Plautus
eumpse, eapse, eopse, suopte. Cf. 9 50, 974.

face =fac, frequent in Plautus and Terence.

801. quod tacere queat, ‘which she can hold her tongue about3’
tacere is found with an accusative in this sense even in Cicero.

802. quid P ‘ why?’

quin. Cf. 118, 291 note.

804. operta; opertam is a frequentative of operio used by Ennius.
This reading involves least change from operito given by the MSS.

806. at enim. Cf. 61 note.

803. me vide, ‘look to me,' i.e. ‘trust to me.’ Cf. Ter. And. 3503
ib. Phor. 711.

And. 948.

810. portitores Cf. 794.

811. quid illum putas? ‘ what do you think about him Τ Cf. Ter.
Ad. 6 56. These phrases may have originated in an ellipse of facere.

The Sycophant is the subject understood both of poterit and dicet, 814.

tum -—- ‘ moreover.'

815. conduco, ‘ 1 will certainly hire?

817. meditatum probe, ‘ properly primed.’ Cf. 896.
