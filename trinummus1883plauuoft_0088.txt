60 PLA VT] TRINVMMVS.

the Prologues are meant to be delivered in character; viz. in the
Trinummus by Luxuria and Inopia, in the Aulularia by the Lar Fami-
liaris, in the Amphitruo by Mercury, in the Mercator by Charinus (a
character in the play), in the Rudens by Arcturus. The Prologues are
sometimes of considerable length, e. g. 152 lines in the Amphitruo, and
often contain remarks as to the proper behaviour of the audience, as in
the Poenulus, where nurses are requested not to introduce babies, ‘ne et
ipsae sitiant, et pueri pereant same; neve esurientes lzz'c quasi lzaea'z·
obvagiant?

Plautine prologues do not contain personal answers to criticismS‚ such
as we sometimes find in Terence; which is natural enough, since most
of them are certainly later additions—not earlier than the first or second
century BC.

The Prologue of the Trinummus has the best claim to be considered
genuine.

Line 1. hac se. via.

munus fungaris tuom z fzmgor governs the accusative in
Plautus and Terence: cf. 354. The only exception is in Ter. Ad. 603,
where the MSS. give the ablative. Cf. Ter. Ad. 464, Phor. 281. Utor
and potior are sometimes found with the accusative before and after the
Augustan age: Ter. Ad. 871 ‘patria potitur commoda ;' ib. 815, ib. 876:
cf. infra, 682. Fruar is found once with accusative in Terence, Heaut.
401, elsewhere with the ablative.

3. ema-en in the comic poets. It is to be distinguished from Hem,
an interjection used to arrest attention or express any strong emotion.
Cf. 185 note, 413, 531, 603, 923.

Em is not elided z em illae being scanned either ἔνη {lla—e or em 'lla-e.
illaec, fem. plural from illic (ille-ce), an archaic form found only in
Plautus and Terence. Cf. illaec fem. sing. 6, and z'llz'c 276. Haec is
the usual form of the nom. fem. plural in Plautus. Cf. 390.
nunciam = nuncjam, but is scanned as three syllables.
4. paucis, se. verbis.
in viam, etc., ⁶ I will set you on the right track.’

5. dare. The pres. inf. is often used for the fut. inf. in the comic
writers after verbs of hoping, promising, threatening‚ etc. Cf. Aul.
108, Ter. And. 2 38. The subject of the infinitive in such constructions
seems to be inserted or omitted indifferently (cf. 755, 956) when it is
the same as that of the principal verb.

8. Luxuriae. For the dative in expressions of naming cf. 18, 20,
843.

11. vocivas :vacuas, less correctly spelt vacz‘vas. Vocare and vacuus
were forms in common use even in the Augustan age.
