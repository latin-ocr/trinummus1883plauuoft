ACT Π. SCENE 4.

Philto asks Lesbonicus to give his sister to Lysiteles in marriage
without dowry. Lesbonicus assents after some hesitation to the mar·
riage3 but declares his intention of giving all that remains of his
property as a dowry. The Act concludes without this point being
settled. The audacious fictions by which Stasimus persuades Philto to
reject the land offered by Lesbonicus, form one of the most amusing
features in the play, second only to the dialogue between Charmides
and the Sycophant.
