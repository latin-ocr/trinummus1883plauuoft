XX INTRODUCTION.

syllable being always considered as long. The Caesura in the
third foot (the peullzemz‘meml caesura) is often preserved. The
Iambic Trimeter is ordinarily employed when the dialogue is
not specially excited.

Π. 'I'he 'I'roehaio Tetrameter Cataleotie consists in its
pure form of seven trochees and a half. In the comic poets
the Tribrach, Spondee, Anapaest, and Dactyl are permitted in
any foot except the seventh, where only the Trochee, Tribrach
and sometimes Dactyl are found. This metre usually has a
break at the end of the fourth foot, where hiatus is sometimes
admitted. Trochaic metre is used to express excitement or
strong emotion, see e.g. the dialogue between Lesbonicus and
Lysiteles 627 sqq.

ΠΙ. 'I'he Troohaio Tetrameter Aoataleetie consists in its
pure form of eight trochees, for which the Tribrach, Spondee,
Anapaest, and Dactyl may be substituted in any foot except
the last, which only admits the Trochee and Spondee. It is
used when the subject requires special dignity of expression,
e.g. the thanksgiving of Charmides 820 sqq.

The metres of the Canticum, or lyrical monologue, and the
short dialogue which immediately follows it, are so doubtful
that a lengthened discussion of thern would be out of place
in a School edition. The subject *has been elaborately treated
by A. Spengel, Reformvorschl'age zur Metrik der Lyrischen
Versarten bei Plautus, 1882.

In any of the above-mentioned metres the Spondee is some-
times resolved into ψψυυ (called a Proceleusmatic), especially
in the first foot. Cf. 289, 557, 767, 806.

The Prosody of the comic poets has been for centuries a
subject on which widely differing opinions have been held.
Cicero De Orat. 55, ξ 184 writes —‘At comicorum propter sz'-
militudinem sermonis sz'c saepe sunt abjecti senarii, ut nonnun-
quam vix in eis numerus et versus z'7ztellzgz‘ possit.² The opinion
of Horace A. P. 270-4 has been already quoted (see Introduction:
also Hor. Ep. II. i. 170, A. P. 54) ; and Priscian tells us that there
