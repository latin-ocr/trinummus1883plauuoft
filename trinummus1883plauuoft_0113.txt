to which further parallels might be given, seems opposed to this; but
animi was so commonly used, that a genitive might easily be added on

1. 136, where Madvig's quoted assertion ought surely to be qualified by
fidens animi Virg. A. 2. 61, and especially Brix on Capt. 261,where
this case is explained as a genitive of relation.

l. 455. condicionem. Cf. 159 note.
456. ferentarium, ‘a friend in need.' Metaphor from battle, the

ferentarii being light-armed troops, placed as skirmishers on the
flanks, who, moving quickly‚ could bring aid where it was most
wanted.

457. abin hine dierecte Ρ an indignant question, like etiam tu taces
514, 790, equivalent to an imperative; dierectus (dis-erigo) =⁵ stretched

cf. 502.
462. in aetate. Cf. 24 note.
463. oculum effodiam. Cf. Aul. 187, where it is joined with a

468. cenam. A cena popularis, given out of the tithe due to the
temple of Hercules, or by some general, who was celebrating a triumph,

curia, where the curiales (see Dict. Ant.) used to meet for worship and
other purposes; in this case for a public feast, and so called ἑστιατόριον
Dionys. Halic. 2. 23. ’

469. ρεφεὸμόκλινος, a partner in the same κλίνη, where the people
reclined at dinner ; hence called biclinium, Bacch. 720. The reference
is to Greek, not Roman, manners.

like a gloss on cenam 468 ; 471 is unnecessary and awkward in view
of 472.

471. The cena appears to be one where the clients have brought
their contributions (symbolae).
