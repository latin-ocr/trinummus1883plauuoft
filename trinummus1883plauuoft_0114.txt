86 PLA VT] TRJNmffMVS. ΙΙ. 4. 71—94.

1. 472. siet. Cf. 76 note. -

473. edis, subjunctive, the apodosis of the numerous hypothetical
clauses which have preceded.

accubeS, like accumbo, the technical word for reclining at table.

474. nisi Si, like εἰ μὴ εἰ, πλὴν ἐάν, quasi si, the hypothetical force
of the first word seeming to be forgotten. Cf. Capt. 530.

477. de vita mea, ‘ from my subsistence?

479. A piece of pompous nonsense.

cernitur, ‘men decide!

480. rem, ‘the truth.’

482. de honore populi, ‘from competition for office‚' as isa slave
had a chance of competing.

483. non hercle hoc longe, ‘not even this much,’ explaining the
word by a gesture, and so using it δεικτικῶς. Cf. 60 note, Most. 2. 1. 46,
where this very expression occurs, and Ter. Ad. 278 ne tam quidem.

484. ‘With our present prices a dinner is an unencumbered inherit-
ance‚' lit. ‘one not burdened with the expense of keeping up the private
sacrifices of the family.’ Cf. Cic. de Leg. 2. ¹9· 48, who says, that if
the father of a family died, the obligation of supporting the family-sacra
remained with the heir. The phrase occurs Capt. 775.

485. The construction is lu facito (ut) cogites lzoc.

488. condicionem. Cf. 159 note. The match may be regarded
either as an offer made by Philto to Lesbonicus, or as a boon asked by
Philto of Lesbonicus. From the first point of view Philto uses fero
(offer) and accz'perffi from the second he uses peto and dare.

491. factiones. Cf. 452 note, ¹497.

492. scintillula animae, ‘a mere spark of life.' None of the read-
ings are satisfactory here. A. has the ⁴ vox nihili ' satillum, from which
Ritschl gets sitellam, ‘ a small urn.’ Wagner keeps salz‘llum, the read-
ing of B, C, D; but ‘ a small salt-cellar of life ’ is surely a somewhat
strained expression. Brix conjectures—

Scintzllulam ammae qui quom extemplo emi‘szmus.
His arrangement keeps qui (g iven by the MSS. for quam), but there is
not much more to be said for it. The reading of the text is that adopted
by Fleckeisen

493— 4. ‘The beggar after death is rated by the banks of Acheron
with the same assessment as the master of mighty wealth? Ad Ache-
runtem as ad T rebmm, etc. Philto means no more, than that death 1s
the great leveller of high and 10w; but Stasimus supposes that he
laments his inability to take his riches to Hades. Hence the ironical
tone of his reply.

495. mirum quin feras, ‘ of course it is a wonder that you cannot
