111. 2. 39-49· NOTES. LINES 642-678. 95

1. 665. ingenium ingenuom, ‘your noble nature.'
admodum is connected with pernovi.
667. amoris teneo, etc., ⁶ I myself understand all the ways of love?
Cf. 780, Ter. And. 86.
668. hamsta, here=a missile hurled from an engine resembling a
gigantic cross-bow3 usually it means the engine itself. We should say
‘ a cannon-ball.’

neque volat, sc. sz'c celeriter.
669. moros, Gr. μωρός-τ ‘ foolish.' ‘ silly.' Notice the alliteration and

paronomasia in these lines. ‘And he makes men’s moods mooning and
moody.'

671. inopiast, sc. alicuius rei. Capias and velis are potential.

672. This line is doubtless a gloss on 6703 such a gloss is called a
dittography.

aspeffit = (lb-spellz’t.

673. insanum was used as an intensive adverb in the cornic writers.
Cf. Most. 5. 3. 5 quid porticum? Insanum bonam. ‘ ’Tis an outrage-
ously bad inn to put up at the sign of Cupidss

devorti is used with a middle sense. An inn was called devor-
sarium ; i. e. ‘ the place where you turn out of the way?

675. The MSS. read ,τί istuc ut conarefacz's indicium, tuum incendes
genus, which gives no good sense. The whole passage is very corrupt.

675—78. The simplest alteration is merely to place ut after conare
instead of before. The general sense will then be as follows :-‘1f
you really attempt to do what you say, i. e. give away the last remnant
of your property as your sister's dowry, you will bring your family into
the greatest danger and disgrace. Then you will be taking some
desperate step, as lovers are wont to do, to avoid the ruin staring you
in the face, and will enlist as a mercenary under some Asiatic prince,
with a good chance of never seeing your country again, and thus extin-
guish the last gleam of hope for the restoration of your family) Cf.
595-599; 700-7023 722-724.

The metaphor of setting fire to a family probably includes the
danger of absolute ruin and the moral disgrace of bringing beggary on
an illustrious house. The aquae cupido would be the overpowering
desire to put an end to so intolerable a condition by any means. As the
existence of a family was,'in those days, typified by the fire on the

. hearth, to extinguish the last spark would naturally imply the final

extinction of the house. v
The reading adopted by Ritseh1‚ etc. (67 5),
Sz' istuc quod conare facis, incendia incendes genus,
is a conjecture of Nitzsch.
