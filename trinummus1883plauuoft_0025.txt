were people of his time, i.e. about the end of the fifth century
A.D., who denied the existence of any metres at all in Terence.

Much light has, however, been thrown on this subject by the
labours of modern scholars, especially Ritschl, and one leading
principle has been established with tolerable certainty : viz.
that the scansion depends on the accent of the word as spoken,
and not on any rigid rules of Prosody, such as were observed
by the Augustan poets. The versification of PlautuS, as far as
Prosody is concerned, may be compared to that of Shakspeare.

With regard to the pronunciation of Latin in the comic poets
three general tendencies may be observed :—

Ι. ¹1¹0 shorten the last syllable of a word.

ΙΙ. 'I'o shorten unaooented syllables.

ΙΙΙ. 'I'o eontraet two syllables into one, called Synizesis
in the case of vowels.

Ι. With regard to the shortening of a final syllable we have direct
evidence in some cases from Cicero, Quintilian, and Priscian.¹

(a) Afinal -m was scarcely pronounced, and so can be dis-
regarded in comic metreS. Cf. Quin. ix. 4, 40 ; Priscian Ι. 38.

(β) Α final -s was frequently dropped, and can be similarly
disregarded. Cf. Cic. De Orat. 48, 161. Marius Victorinus Ι.
p. 2472. Even -as, -os, -es, in acc. pl. and -is in dat. and abl.
pl. may be shortened: cf. 822, 868.

(γ) Α final -t seems to have followed the same rule, as dede
is found for dedit in ancient inscriptions, and there are nu-
merous instances in Plautus and Terence when a syllable
ended in -t is scanned as short before a consonant.

It' seems highly probable that this tendency, clearly proved
with reference to some terminations, extended to others, e. g.
a final -r (pate is actually found for pater in an inscription), a
final -d‚ e.g. in apud (the form ape being found in an ancient
-glossary=7rapd), final -1 as in simul, final -n as in tamen. It
-is possible that even final v-nt may sometimes have been
dropped, as emeru for emerunt is found in an inscription, and

ἡ there are lines which seem to require it, e.g. Ter. Eun. 384,

Ad. 900, Haut. 993.
