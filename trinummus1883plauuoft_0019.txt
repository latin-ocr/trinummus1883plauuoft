of good principles as the integmnentzmz vitae (313) ; or such as
are distinctly Roman, e.g. ferentarium amicum (456), os quoi
sublz'nat (558), and concenturiant metum (1002).

As we do not possess anything but fragments of the New

Comedy, from which the Roman dramatists borrowed, it is
impossible to estimate the amount of originality, which belongs

to any play of Plautus taken as a whole3 but the ease and
vigour of his language would show clearly that he was treating
his models with some freedom, if this fact were not also evident
from the numerous Roman allusions, to which reference has
already been made.

Plautus and. his audienoe. Plautus⁷ early connexion with
the stage gave him the experience requisite for writing a good
acting play. We see it in the broad humour of the dialogues,
in the variety of the action, and in the dramatic character of the
situations. And, besides, he knew well for whom he was writing3
and his audience was not of a high class. The greater the
extravagance, the more amusement it gave3 and it is to the
knowledge of this that we must attribute the productiori of part
of the fourth act of the Trz'nzcmmus, We can imagine how the
excitable spectators screamed with laughter when the Syco-
phant calmly declared that Pontus was in Arabia, and how
eagerly they waited to see if his effrontery would support
him in declaring that he had positively been introduced to
Jove.

Appreeiation of Plautus„ The popularity of Plautus con-
tinued very great for some time after his death, until his plays
were gradually superseded by the more polished comedy of
Terence. Cicero, however (de Off. i. 29), classes his wit with
the Atticorum antiqua comoedz'a3 but in the last years of the
Republic and the early years of the Empire the rhetorical
character of education led men to prefer tragedy to comedy.
'Horace acknowledges the general appreciation of the vivacity
of style ancl action so conspicuous in Plautus ; for (Epist. ii. Ι.
58) he says dicitur. . . Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare
’ Epicharmi,- but his own opinion is disparaging (A. P. 270—4).
