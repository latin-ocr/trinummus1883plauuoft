are used by Plautus: quaesti, tumulti, victi, senati, sumpti, gemiti ;
and used by Terence, quaesti, tumulti, fructi, ornati, adventi.

1. 2 51. ducitur familia tota, ‘ a whole household is brought in,' i. e.
by the lady, when she visits her lover’s house. Note the long final a
in familia, the original quantity.

252. unctor, a slave, who anointed people in the bath 3 called aliptes
by Juvenal, 3. 76. The Greek ἀλείπτης, however, was the manager of
the wrestling school, who took care that the wrestlers anointed them-
selves properly.

flabelliserae, sandaligerulae‚ cistellatrioes, ἅπαξ λε’γ. This
last=⁶ keepers of the jewel box?

253. nuntii renuntii‚ <messengers to and fr0.’

254. raptores panis et penit, ‘who make short work of loaf and
larder.' panis is really superfluous, being included in penus (both are
connected with the root of pasco); the alliteration gives unity to the
expression. ,

256. haec, the ruinous extravagance of love and its results, as further
shown in the following line. The reading here is uncertain. The text
follows A.

257. ubi qui eget, etc., ‘ how lightly esteemed is the man who isin
want.'

ubi quj=si quis. Cf. 439 note, 1005.

In preti the last syllable is shortened.

259. illud, explained by the following infinitives.

260. quod sit aegre, ‘ to worry us,’ a common expression in Plautus
and Terence, but in most cases used impersonally.

262. This line simply means that love is at length driven away by
the troubles and worries occasioned by itself.

263. Pointless, and regarded as spurious by almost all the com-
mentators.

264. ignorandust, ‘ must be disregarded‚' a rare use of ignoro.

abstandus. This verb is found only once elsewhere (Hor. A. P.
362), and then in its natural intransitive sense. Its personal use in the
gerundive, impiying a transitive active, is therefore very eurious. Cf.
1159 placenda, (where see note), and Epid. 1. 1. 70 pereunda puppis est
probe.

265. saxo, i. e. the Tarpeian. See Introduction.
· 266. sis=si vis.
tuas res tibi habeto, the ordinary form of divorce prescribed by
the Twelve Tables. Cf. Cic. Phil. 2. 69 suas res sibi habere jussit:
ex duodecim tabulis claves ademit, i. e. has restored her dowry, and taken

from her the household keys, the symbol of domestic government.
