faxo: fecero The future perfect is often used in Plautus and
Terence to express a quickly completed future action where 1n English
we should employ the future simple. Cf. 1007. Faxo stands parentheti—

61. namque enim. ΕΠΖ-Νι is often found with an intensive force,

503 Ce7le emm 5620. Cf. Liv. 22, 25; Virg. G. 2, 509 Namque
emm are not found in this connection elsewhere, but we have the
similar expressions, namque hercle, infra 7 31, namque edepol, six times
in Plautus, namque ecastor, Cist. 71. Various conjectures have been
made to avoid the namque enim which is the reading of all the MSS„
e.g. nempe enim (Ritschl'>; nanctum em'm te credis quem . . . (VVagner);
nunquam (Camerarius). The connection of ideas is as follows:—
Callieles sayS‚ 6Ι warrant you won't have deceived me in the least.’
Megaronides replies, ε(Ι should think not) for assuredly 'tis you,
Ι think, who will have stolen a march upon me unawares.’

obrepo in Augustan Latin gov erns a dative.

the order of lines 59-64; the text preserves the order of the MSS.
