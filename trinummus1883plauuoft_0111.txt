407. This line is closely copied by Terence, Eun. 2 57.

408. We need not trouble ourselves about the appearance of myro-
polae between holitores and aucupes (poulterers). It is not likely that
the persumers provided anything to eat. The word was suggested by
emotum, and Stasimus is not particular about the order of his enu-
meration.

414. Two possible translations. (Ι) ⁶ the whole affair cannot be
clear to you, if you content yourself with spending,’ i. e. and leave the

(2) ‘ if you are always spending, the money must be all gone,’ lit. ‘ not
visible,' as adparet in 419.

417. rationem putat, ⁴ reckons his account ;' putare, lit. = ‘ to make
clear,’ being from the same root as purus.

post in the apodosis aster postquam, pleonastic and emphatic.
Cf· 9752 998-

418. There is a play on conparet and adparet3 Lesbonicus meaning
‘clear to the mind‚' i. e. ‘consistentss Stasimus ‘visible to the eye.'
Trans. ‘however, the balance of the money account is by no means
clear. ST. The account is clear enough ; but the money has cleared-off?

421. mancupio aceepit, ‘formally received.'

admodum, ‘ exactly so.'
422. opino. The active form occurs six times in Plautus.
adfinis noster, i. e. Lesbonicus, who is to be connected by mar·
n‘age with Philto. Cf. 622. For another (metaphorical) sense of
adfinis, see 331.

423. in portast locus, i. e.' ‘to beg.’

424. A grim joke; filio of course :filii in sense.

425. mille in the singular is always used as a substantive by Plautus,
just as milia by everyone. Cf. 954, 959, 966, 970, 1139. redditae,
however, as if the nominative were mille drachumae.

drachuma is the old 'form from δραχμή, like Alcumena from
Ἀλκμήνη, etc.

trapezita (τραπεζίτης), one os the bankers, who had stalls in the
forum.
