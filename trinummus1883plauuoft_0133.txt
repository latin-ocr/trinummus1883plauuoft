iam dudum. Cf. 608 note, ⁴ just now? In Augustan Latin iam
dudum=‘a long while ago.’ Ritschl assumes that a line has dropped
out of the MSS. aster 923, sor which he suggests, non placet, qua te erga
amicum video amicitia utz'er, referring to 909. There may, however, be
a double meaning in the words dixi ego, etc. ‘ 1 (the very man whose
name you have been trying to remember) have been speaking to
you now for some time.’ A similar double meaning would give
additional point to lines 924 and 926, and is strongly suggested by
927.
