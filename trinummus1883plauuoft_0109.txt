11.2.78-103. NOTES. LINES 344—383. 81

1. 360. quin=isne qui.

361. nevolt. Cf. 328 note.

362. mentire, ‘you mistake‚' just like Greek ψεύδεσθαι.

365. multa illi opera opust ficturae. It is not likely that Plautus
wrote this sentence as it stands, but perhaps nothing better can be ex·
tracted from the MSS.

opera (ablative) fioturae= ‘ aid of (from) the moulding-process‚'
a very awkward phrase. Trans. ‘a man needs great aid from ability to
mould, who wishes to mould skilfully the course of his life? For se
esse expetit cf. 324 volo me exorare.

367. apiscitur; a solitary instance of this verb in the passive sense.
Tacitus, however, has adipiscendus. After this the MSS. give the
meaningless line—

Sapienti aetas condimentum, sapiens aetati cz‘bust.

369. qm‘cquam, pleonastic after nil, as Ter. And. 90.

372. volo edoceas. Cf. 59 note.

lieet, an ordinary formula of assent. Cf. 517.

373. Note that the subject of the dependent sentence appears as the
object (illum) of the principal verb, a construction common enough in
Greek. Cf. 88, 580, 698, 960. ’

374. adulta grandjS, ² grown-up and marriageable.' The two words
mean the same thing. and the expression is pleonastic for the sake of
emphasis. For grandis cf. Ter. Ad. 673.

375. Note the position of -ne, as in 178, 515, 1022. Here, however,
a distinct reason can be assigned, since sine dote and uxoremne are

two separate questions,

377. auxiliarier. For the form cf. 86 note.

378. ut patiar, ‘ (do you demand) that Ι should allow you (to marry) ’ξ

379. lepidam famam, simply: ‘ good name.’

380. quamvis adverbially with facunde, just as with longi, 797.
Cf. 554 note.

381. veterem atque antiquam. These words are sometimes com·
bined (Lindemann, Mil. 3. 1. 155 note) to express two different ideas;
vetus=‘of old date,' antz'quzc's,=‘of old character;’ as Pliny, Paneg.
11. 4 homines veteres et antiqui ; cf. mores antiqui, 723 but as
applied to historia (⁶ stories ³) they are probably joined only for
emphasis

haee mea senectus sustinet, ‘ my old head holds' (Brix). The
point of this and the preceding line is, that Philto could argue ably
and learnedly against his son's proposa13 but, as he goes on to say, he
prefers to give in.

383. istac, ‘in the way that you propose.’
