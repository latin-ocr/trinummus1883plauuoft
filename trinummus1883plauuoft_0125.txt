etiam ob . . . tueris, ‘do you still defend yourself with regard to

emendation from the MS. reading multa ob omina B, or multa almmina
C,D; but it must be admitted that difficulty is not wholly avoided
thereby. For though the Praetors had the right of flogging aetors (ius
virgarum) there is no mention of punishment by fine even as late as the
time of Tiberius3 cf. Tac. An. i. 77 ; infra 990 note.
