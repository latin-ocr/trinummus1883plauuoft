1. 1069 horno is placed in the relative clause, merely, as it seems, to
put it by the side of hominis.

1073. salvom te. For the full phrase, see 1097.

1075. filium et filiam, added as an afterthought, and put in the
accusative because they stand nearer to quos than to liberi mei.

1076. nempe. Cf. 196 note.

1077. otiosse. For the spelling, cf. effossae, 37 note.

1078. quonam te agis, ‘wherever are you taking yourself?’

1081. praesentariis, etc.. ‘ for silver minae, ready money, paid down.’

animum adimit would mean, ‘ makes me faint.'
visne petam. Cf. 59 note.

1092. offusam, sc. aquam.

Sat. 1. 10. 21. ,

1097. Itis generally supposed that something has been lost in the
